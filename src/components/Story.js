                &emsp;&emsp;The Story mode is a single-player campaign 
                taking place in Lakeshore, a fictional 
                interpretation of Chicago, Illinois, in 
                which the player competes in in-game weekly 
                qualifiers for a place in the Grand: Lakeshore's 
                ultimate street racing challenge. 
                <br/><br/>
                &emsp;&emsp;Unable to stop 
                a robbery at a family auto-shop, two friends 
                are pushed to breaking point, giving the 
                player an opportunity to make their mark on 
                the streets earning rep to go from rookie to 
                top racer by winning the Grand and reclaiming a 
                stolen custom car. 
                <br/><br/>
                &emsp;&emsp;The player has to take risks 
                to get attention, but they can make their 
                choices; pulling huge drifts, taking on the 
                Lakeshore Police Department, or placing 
                side-bets on rivals. Although the player can 
                choose how they make their mark, the more 
                attention they earn means turning up the heat.
                <br/><br/>
                &emsp;&emsp;As part of the player's path, they'll meet 
                A$AP Rocky, the prominent rapper and fashion 
                icon, for a chance to take him on head-to-head 
                as a test of skill and style. Better yet, it's 
                a chance to take his custom 1988 Mercedes-Benz 
                190E 2.5-16 for a drive.
